         "['Daily mobility practices through mobile phone data: An application in lombardy region[SEP]Beginning with the results of a research carried out in the Italian region of Lombardy utilising mobile phone data provided by Telecom Italia, this chapter will demonstrate how new maps, based on mobile phone data and better tailored to the dynamic processes taking place, can represent spatialized urban practices and origin-destination flows of daily movements. Three different types of mobile phone data were employed in the analysis of complex temporal and spatial patterns. The first data type concerns the mobile phone traffic registered by the network over the entire Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). Data are expressed in Erlang, a measure of the density of calls. The second typology of data consists in localized and aggregated tracks of anonymized mobile phone users. It is an origin-destination datum derived from the Call Detail Record database. The third type of data refers to the mobile switching centre (MSC), which is the primary service delivery node for GSM, responsible for routing voice calls and text messages.

Beginning with the results of a research carried out in the Italian region of Lombardy, utilising mobile phone data provided by Telecom Italia, the paper will demonstrate how new maps, based on mobile phone data and better tailored to the dynamic processes taking place, can represent spatialized urban practices, provide new insights into the analysis of space-time patterns of mobility practices and be employed to recognise different communities of practice. Mobile traffic data were treated as the effect of individual behaviours and habits that become aggregates, offering information about the features of usage of urban spaces that vary in time. The outcomes permit a visualisation of the spatial distribution of mobility flows, in addition to describing the experiential dimensions of commuting rhythms. It is possible to argue that commuting can be conceived as a mobile practice that exploits a rich variety of places of use in accordance with the temporal organisation of a day. The processing of mobile phone data, by offering new maps of site practices in Lombardy and information on temporary populations and city usage patterns (daily/nightly practices, non-systematic mobility), made it possible to trace 'fuzzy boundaries' as perimeters of practice.

This paper presents a methodology to simulate disaggregate and synthetic household travel survey data by examining the feasibility of the spatial transferability of travel data. Households are clustered into several homogeneous groups to identify the distributions of their travel attributes. These distributions are then transferred to similar groups in other regions. Furthermore, updating methods are suggested and developed to calibrate the parameters of the transferred distributions for the application area. A user friendly software is developed that facilitates the entire process. To validate the model, a synthetic population for the state of New York, excluding the New York City, is generated by a two-stage population synthesis procedure. Then, travel attributes of each household are simulated and by linking the generated travel data to the synthetic population, a synthetic household travel dataset is generated for the application context. Finally, using a new validation dataset from the application area, comparisons against the simulated data are made to examine the effectiveness of the simulation process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Comparative analysis of household activity matching approaches in transportation analysis and simulation system[SEP]Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is a microsimulation model, which uses census data to generate a synthetic population and assigns activities using activity survey data to each person of every household of the synthetic population. The synthetic households generated from the census data are matched with the survey households based on their demographic characteristics. The activities of the survey household individuals are then assigned to the individuals of the matched synthetic households. A classification and regression tree algorithm program is used to build the matching tree for the activity survey households based on some demographic independent variables. The current TRANSIMS model utilizes times spent at activities as dependent variables for building the classification tree. This research instead uses the travel times for travel between activities as dependent variables, i.e., using the travel time pattern instead of activity time pattern to match the persons in the survey households with the synthetic households. This approach assumes that if the travel time patterns are the same then we can match the survey households to the synthetic population, i.e., people with similar demographic characteristics tend to have similar travel time patterns. The algorithm of the activity generator module along with the original set of dependent variables were first used to generate a base case scenario. Further tests were carried out using an alternative set of dependent variables in the algorithm. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the affect of different sets of dependent and independent variables in generating activities using the algorithm of the activity generator.

Agent-based micro-simulation models attempt to forecast travel behaviour of individuals and households by simulating the behaviour of the singular actors in the system. The framework for generating synthesis population presented in this paper is a fundamental contribution to the development of an Integrated Transport, Land Use and Environment Modelling System in Nova Scotia, Canada. In this paper, a population is synthesized for individuals and households in Atlantic Canada using the Fitness Based Synthesis (FBS) approach. A synthetic algorithm is designed that allows both individual and household attribute levels to synthesize simultaneously. Unequal probabilities based on the sampling weight are used in the household selection step of the algorithm. In this way, the performance and accuracy of the synthetic population produced has been improved. The synthetic algorithm is tested for two functions: first, using the one level (household) control tables; and second, using two levels (individual and household) control tables. The data used in this study is collected from the 2006 Canadian Census and the 2006 Public Use Micro-data File (PUMF). The algorithm is implemented using a high-level matrix programming language for numerical computation in MATLAB. The results show that the synthetic population with both individual and household level attributes has the best fitness value. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.']"

With the rapidly growing floating population in China, it is important for the decision-makers to accurately estimate the distribution of per capita share of grain and its dynamics. The variation of per capita share of grain at the finer spatial scale is ignored by most studies at national or provincial levels. Population data used in the calculation of the per capita share of grain are not consistent, but there is large difference between the size of registered population and resident population in some areas. This inconsistency will greatly influence the interpretation of the spatial pattern and trend of per capita share of grain as well as the food transportation policy. Based on the county-level data of registered population and resident population in China\\'s fifth and sixth censuses, this paper conducts a comparative analysis of spatial-temporal patterns and trends of county-level per capita grain, when either registered or resident population is used. Several spatial data analysis methods are used, such as Global Moran\\'s I, LISA, gravity centers curve and the thematic map series. The results show that: Firstly, per capita share of grain in China demonstrates obvious east- west and south-north divides. Per capita share of grain is significantly correlated over space no matter which population data is adopted. High- high clusters are concentrated in Northeast China, northwestern Xinjiang and parts of Central China. Low-low clusters are mainly distributed in coastal provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and South China. Such a spatial agglomeration is growing over time. The spatial clusters of high values tend to form in Northeast China, while the cold spots have emerged in Southeast China. Secondly, spatial distribution of per capita share of grain differs a lot when two kinds of population data are used. Such differences grow over time, with most of them concentrated to the south of 800 mm rainfall line as well as in South China and Southwest China. This is in line with the fact that the active regions of floating population are mainly located in the eastern monsoon region to the south of 800 mm rainfall line. Although the spatial pattern of serious food shortage regions is consistent under either population standard, migration has intensified the degree of food shortage in these regions. At the same time, calculation result based on resident population shows that, more commodity grain can be exported by counties in Northeast China, Huang- Huai- Hai Region and Sichuan Province. Thirdly, the gravity center change curve of per- capita share of grain presents an \"L\" shape and has a greater increase and decrease to the north and southeast respectively. Integrating the thematic map series and gravity centers curve of per capita share of grain, we identify seven kinds of regions: large increase, moderate increase, small increase, zero growth, small decrease, moderate decrease and large decrease. Such patterns differ between the two population criteria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Estimation of urban population at daytime and nighttime and analyses of their spatial pattern: A case study of Haidian District, Beijing[SEP]Urban population at daytime and nighttime and their spatial distribution are basis for planning urban infrastructure, public services and disaster relief, and it is also a leading edge for urban geography study. Because current statistical data in China cannot distinguish urban population at daytime from that at nighttime, existing research in this field is limited. Aiming to estimate urban population at daytime and nighttime and to analyze their spatial characteristics, this paper establishes a relationship model among urban population, time (daytime or nighttime) and types of land-use, and a population spatial distribution model based on different area weights, and also conducts an empirical study on the Haidian District in Beijing. The results are shown as follows. (1) There are many differences between daytime and nighttime population in spatial structure. Population is more concentrated during daytime. (2) There are many spatial coupling relationships between daytime and nighttime population, such as sandwich mode, inlay mode, convergence mode, and monomer mode. (3) There is a great difference in the use of road networks between daytime and nighttime. This phenomenon is related to the spatial distribution between daytime and nighttime. It seems that daytime population has a notable influence on road expansion. The spatial distribution of daytime and nighttime population also reflects some phenomena in the development of China, such as the distribution of old residential areas, the construction of new industrial districts, the differences between urban and rural areas, which can provide some reference for the studies in this field and other regional research. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Spatial Patterns of Urban Activities in Osaka City : An attempt for examination and integration by applying of spatial autocorrelation concepts[SEP]The study of spatial patterns of urban activities has been approached from to main points of vie, factorial ecology and urban economic geography, hose major empasises are quite different. Factorial ecology pays particular attension to the spatial distribution of socio-economic characteristics of urban residents based on a nighttime urban structure. Urban economic geography, on the other hand, analyzes the areal arrangement of economic activities ithin a daytime urban structure. In their approaches to spatial analysis and pattern specification, to defects are common to both points of vie : 1) Quasi-subjective identification of spatial patterns, and 2) failure to integrate diverse aspects of urban activities according to their time-serial occurence. The present article is a search for synthetic explanation of spatial structure of diverse urban activities, by applying spatial autocorrelation concepts to obtain pattern identification and integration. The research is divided into three major phases, outlined belo : The dynamic process of spatial patterns produced by urban activities occurs, and should be investigated, at various time. In this paper, the annual time series and the 24-hour cycle constitute the to major time spans. The annual time series is used in reference to changes in spatial patterns of economic activities, and the 24-hour cycle refers to the inter-transformation of spatial patterns of quotidian urban activities, appropriately represented by daytime, nighttime and intermediate population characteristics. b) Spatial autocorrelation concepts, defined as spatial interdependency based on contiguity, are very useful in undertaking exact spatial pattern analysis. The coefficient I, devised by Moran and improved by Cliff and Ord, is used for test of pattern. I is evaluated from (formula ommited) Spatial interdependency, hich is significant as underyling spatial structure, is expressed in the eight matrix. c) Combining the to above analysis, e can proceed to an explanation of spatialtemporal processes of patterns. They are modeled on the independent variables of spatial and/or spatial-temporal lag components, hich are equivalent to the received influences of each cell from the neighbors and evaluated from the most valid eight matrix in the test of spatial autocorrelation. The data ere collected in Osaka City, the second largest economic metropolis in Japan, a city that shos a remarkable transformation of spatial patterns of urban activities ithin 24 hours. All the data ere compiled into 1,010 meshes covering hole city, each mesh measuring 500 mx 500 m. 1) Spatial Patterns of Daytime Activities The principal component analysis consists of 26 economic activity variables for 1975. From the results obtained, the first component can be identified as an economic activity agglomerated in the central zone of the city. (Tab. 1) The second component is activity densely distributed in the inner city zone. The to components sho clear centered and ring-like patterns respectively. (Fig. 2 and 3) Both patterns ere examined by testing spatial autocorrelation based on isotropic eight (QUEENG). Hoever, to improve the poer of the test, an attempt as made to construct a center-to-periphery type of eight, hich is properly named as ‘diffusional’. My nely devised ‘diffusional’ eight confirms more clearly the underlying spatial structure of both patterns, hich have a strong directional bias. (Tab. 3. a, b). Statistical explanation of the observed patterns is attempted by using the spatial lag components calculated from the most effective ‘diffusional’ eight matrix. The explanatory model is formulated as the folloing :(formula ommited) High spatial correspondence of the expected and observed patterns and high coefficients of determination ere obtained on a regression analysis. (Tab. 4 and Fig. 6, 7) e can safely say that explanatory poer in analysis of static spatial patterns can be obtained utilizing the spatial lag component as an independent variable. The next step is a comparative spatial-temporal analysis of patterns of economic activities in Osaka City beteen 1969 and 1975. The folloing to simulation models are used. Step-wise simulation model (formula ommited) Muti-mode simulation model (formula ommited) The spatial and temporal lag components are evaluated on the correct assumption of a ‘diffusional’ spatial structure, hich has been proved in the test of spatial autocorrelation to be the most effective structure. From the results of regression analysis shon in Tab. 7, 8, both models are highly effective in the statistical and spatial explanations for the time-serial changes of patterns. (Fig. 9~11). Hoever, it is difficult to determine hich is more effective. 2) Spatial Patterns of Nighttime Activities Twenty-one variables representing ages and occupations of the nighttime population ere used for the principal component analysis. (Tab. 9). The first component is residential characteristics of orkers. Its distribution shos ring-like pattern similar to but less cear than the inner-city type economic activity already mentioned. (Fig. 12). Different types of eights, QUEENG, ‘diffusional’ and multi-center ‘diffusional’ in this case ith to centers, ere applied in a spatial autocorrelation test. (Tab. 10. a, b). The ‘diffusional’ eight has the highest effectivity here. Hoever, due to its less clear spatial structure, the residential pattern is more difficult to explain than the inner-city pattern of economic activity. (Tab. 11 and Fig. 13). 3) Spatial Patterns of Intermediate Activities The flo of commuters, hich recurrs morning and evening, is a significant urban activity in the 24-hour cycle. The areal distribution of commuters shos clear sectorial zonation. Hoever, as appropriate data ere scarce, further analysis is not fully attempted in this paper. e can describe diverse and distinct spatial patterns by mapping of many aspects of urban activities. Each pattern has a static nature, but is also a product of dynamic processes accompanying its formation. Therefore, any spatial pattern should be analyzed by interrelating both a static cross-section and time-series changes, meaning that the study of spatial patterns should be based on the integration of spatial and temporal dimensions. As presented in this paper, spatial and spatial-temporal autocorrelation provides the key concept for this direction of research. Development of this concept is the task that lies ahead for the advancement of truly spatial analysis. © 1982, The Human Geographical Society of Japan.

         "[\"Reverse survival method of fertility estimation: An evaluation[SEP]Background: For the most part, demographers have relied on the ever-growing body of sample surveys collecting full birth history to derive total fertility estimates in less statistically developed countries. Yet alternative methods of fertility estimation can return very consistent total fertility estimates by using only basic demographic information. Objective: This paper evaluates the consistency and sensitivity of the reverse survival method - a fertility estimation method based on population data by age and sex collected in one census or a single-round survey. Methods: A simulated population was first projected over 15 years using a set of fertility and mortality age and sex patterns. The projected population was then reverse survived using the Excel template FE_reverse_4.xlsx, provided with Timæus and Moultrie (2012). Reverse survival fertility estimates were then compared for consistency to the total fertility rates used to project the population. The sensitivity was assessed by introducing a series of distortions in the projection of the population and comparing the difference implied in the resulting fertility estimates. Results: The reverse survival method produces total fertility estimates that are very consistent and hardly affected by erroneous assumptions on the age distribution of fertility or by the use of incorrect mortality levels, trends, and age patterns. The quality of the age and sex population data that is 'reverse survived' determines the consistency of the estimates. The contribution of the method for the estimation of past and present trends in total fertility is illustrated through its application to the population data of five countries characterized by distinct fertility levels and data quality issues. Conclusions: Notwithstanding its simplicity, the reverse survival method of fertility estimation has seldom been applied. The method can be applied to a large body of existing and easily available population data - both contemporary and historical - that so far has remained largely under-exploited, and contribute to the study of fertility levels and trends. © 2014 Thomas Spoorenberg. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", \"The significance of differences in patterns of mortality for population projections[SEP]The significance in patterns of mortality for projections of population have been examined by projecting test stable populations classified by sex and age with constant fertility and declining mortality, according to models West, North, East, and South and according to the United Nations models at intervals of 5 years by the component method. And, by comparing the numbers of males and females in each age group, the total population, the estimated birth and death rates, the proportional distributions at the end of 5, 10, and more years of projected populations based on models' North, East, South, and the United Nations models to those based on model West, two major conclusions are reached. First, as far as the total population is concerned, in medium-term projections (that is, up to 20-25 years) the differences in patterns of mortality do not seem to have much significance. The differences in projected total population owing to differences in patterns of mortality in such projections remain less than one percent. In long-term projections with lower initial expectation of life at birth, however, the models North, East, and South, and the United Nations models tend to underestimate the total population as compared to model West-this underestimation sometimes exceeding one percent and increasing with time. With higher initial expectations of life at birth, these models tend to underestimate the total population as compared to model West, even in short- and medium-term projections. Moreover, in these same projections, the underestimation in total population does not vary with varying speeds of declines in mortality. Second, as far as the proportional distributions and the crude death rates of the projected populations are concerned, the differences in patterns of mortality seem to be of some importance. In general, models North, East, and South and the United Nations model tend to underestimate the children and young adults and to overestimate persons in older ages as compared to model West-the underestimation in most quinquennial age groups being less than 3 to 4 percent, and overestimation especially in ages above 70 years being as much as 30 percent. Nearly always, the deathrate based on models North, East, and South, and on the United Nations models tends to be overestimated as compared to that based on model West. The overestimation was found to vary directly with initial level of œ <inf>0</inf> and speeds of declines in mortality, and inversely with mean age of fertility schedule in medium-term projections. © 1968 Population Association of America. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", \"Disaggregating the historical demographic sources of regional foreign-born and native-born population growth in the United States: A new method with applications[SEP]In this paper we offer a general method for analysing the demographic processes that contribute to population growth and redistribution in a multiregional system.

It uses an open multiregional projection model framework for identifying the contributions to regional growth made by each of the principal demographic components of change: fertility, mortality, immigration, emigration, in-migration and out-migration. At the same time, the method recognises the importance of disaggregating the native-born and foreign-born populations. Available public data and indirect estimation techniques are used to develop the data inputs for the projection model, with which we reconstruct the regional population changes for each five-year period between 1950 and 1990. Regional growth rates for the foreign-born and native-born populations are partitioned into the separate demographic components of change, and the projection model identifies the separate contributions to regional growth made by each population. This allows a direct comparison of the impacts of immigration with those of corresponding native-born contributions effected through internal migration and natural increases. Finally, application of the method allows us to identify the contribution that 'recent' (post-1965) immigrant cohorts have made to the composition of the youngest age groups in each region, and also to simulate the impacts of zero immigration scenarios on regional growth.; This paper analyzes the demographic processes that contribute to population growth and redistribution in a multiregional system using a new method.

         "[\"Epidemic Modelling: Validation of Agent-based Simulation by Using Simple Mathematical Models[SEP]Social contacts are an important channel for the propagation of disease through a population and should be considered in conjunction with traditional epidemic diffusion that is due to meteorological advection. Such channels should always be taken into account for a realistic estimation of a long-term impact of a disease outbreak (natural or malicious) and for the best response options (i.e. optimal immunisation strategy, see Chen et al 2004, Murray 2004, Bootsma et al. 2007). There are currently three main approaches to epidemiological modelling: equation-based (analytical models), agent-based (computer models where populations are presented as a system of interacting software agents) and closely related to this, network based modelling (when social interactions are modelled based on a network theory approach). Agent based and network based approaches are complimentary to each other. The equation-based approach dates back to the celebrated SIR model (S-susceptible, I-Infected, R -Recovered) and its further modifications (see Kermack & McKendrick 1927 and Andersen & May 1979). This approach provides rigorous results and is the simplest to implement, but has an obvious shortcoming in that only simplified scenarios can be treated analytically. Agent-based simulation is the most flexible in terms of realistic scenario evaluation and has become increasingly popular (Germann et al 2006, Chen et al. 2004, Toroczkai et al.2007, Rahmandad et al 2004 and Dunham 2005). With the increasing availability of computer resources it allows high fidelity modelling of epidemical outbreaks on global, national and community levels. The main issue of the agent based approach is model validation, i.e. what is the fidelity of the model output for a given 'what if scenario (which has never occurred) and what means do we have to validate these predictive results? One of the important steps of agent-based model validation is so-called model alignment (see Chen et al 2004), when the agent-based model output is reconciled with other modelling approaches for realistic (observable) values of model parameters. This paper describes our recent experience in developing a complex agent-based model to simulate an epidemic outbreak and comparing the results of the agent-based simulation with a SIR model as the first step in validating the agent based model. The guiding principle when designing this model was to create a research tool that would allow us to do various quantitative studies (sensitivity analysis, data assimilation, reverse problems) as well as ad-hoc operational scenarios based on a small-scale agent based model (that can run on a PC) but with real census data. The model developed is CROWD. It is a civilian population model that takes census data and combines this with city planning information to build an urban population that has homes, families and places of work. CROWD leverages off the Advanced Urban Environment (AUE), a system that models urban buildings and infrastructure, to provide a model physical environment where people live. It allows snapshots of the population dynamics to be taken during a standard day in the life of the city, imitating the circadian rhythms of work, rest and play (see GUI snapshots in Fig. 1). CROWD has a mobile population going about their daily routine and responding to changes in their environment. With CROWD it becomes possible to model the entire population in a plausible manner, providing a population that acts as if it inhabits the city and that reacts to events within their environs without requiring intervention from a puckster. Thus development of such an infrastructure is a critical step in realistic simulation of complex social network dynamics. [GRAPHICS] .\", \"Mixing patterns among epidemic groups[SEP]Epidemic modeling has a long tradition in facilitating an understanding of the spread of infectious agents with direct impact on public health. Recent modeling approaches have specifically improved our understanding of the connections between transmission network topology and epidemic spread: Host populations are generally not well mixed and show heterogeneous and dynamic contact behavior. This results in a broad range of epidemic patterns regarding both speed and width of epidemic expansion. However, there is also a mutual influence between transmission network structure, mixing between susceptible and infected hosts and the epidemic process: epidemic control gets more difficult if infected hosts mix well within the susceptible population. We present a new mathematical framework which allows for a study of mixing patterns between susceptible and infected hosts in populations with very general structural features. While clustering of infected hosts is a qualitatively well known phenomenon, our approach allows for its quantification and puts it in relation to the hosts' overall contact behavior. It shows that different degrees of assortativity emerge depending on the transmission network structure and epidemic stage. This method's use is demonstrated for synthetic populations. It can however easily be transferred to more realistic settings in which information about mixing patterns of epidemic groups is vital for improved epidemic control. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", 'Synthesis of a high resolution social contact network for Delhi with application to pandemic planning[SEP]Objective: We aim to understand quantitatively how targeted-layered containment (TLC) strategies contain an influenza pandemic in a populous urban area such as Delhi, India using networked epidemiology. Methods: A key contribution of our work is a methodology for the synthesis of a realistic individual-based social contact network for Delhi using a wide variety of open source and commercial data. New techniques were developed to infer daily activities for individuals using aggregate data published in transportation science literature in combination with human development surveys and targeted local surveys. The resulting social contact network is the first such network constructed for any urban region of India. This time varying, spatially explicit network has over 13 million people and more than 200 million people-people contacts. The network has several interesting similarities and differences when compared with similar networks of US cities. Additionally, we use a high performance agent-based modeling environment to study how an influenza-like illness would spread over Delhi. We also analyze well understood pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical containment strategies, or a combination thereof (also known as TLCs), to control a pandemic outbreak. Results: (i) TLC strategies produce the mildest and most delayed epidemic out-break than any of the individual interventions; (ii) the epidemic dynamics of Delhi appear to be strongly influenced by the activity patterns and the demographic structure of its local residents; and (iii) a high resolution social contact network helps in analyzing effective public health policies. Conclusion: A high resolution synthetic network is constructed based on surveyed data. It captures the underlying contact structure of a certain population and can be used to quantitatively analyze public health policy effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in the Indian sub-continent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

However, individual spatial behavior may modify residential neighborhood influences, with weaker health effects expected for mobile populations. By examining individual patterns of daily mobility and associated socio-demographic profiles and transportation modes, this article seeks to develop innovative methods to account for daily mobility in health studies. We used data from the RECORD Cohort Study collected in 2011-2012 in the Paris metropolitan area, France. A sample of 2062 individuals was investigated. Participants' perceived residential neighborhood boundaries and regular activity locations were geocoded using the VERITAS application. Twenty-four indicators were created to qualify individual space-time patterns, using spatial analysis methods and a geographic information system. Three domains of indicators were considered: lifestyle indicators, indicators related to the geometry of the activity space, and indicators related to the importance of the residential neighborhood in the overall activity space. Principal component analysis was used to identify main dimensions of spatial behavior. Multilevel linear regression was used to determine which individual characteristics were associated with each spatial behavior dimension. The factor analysis generated five dimensions of spatial behavior: importance of the residential neighborhood in the activity space, volume of activities, and size, eccentricity, and specialization of the activity space. Age, socioeconomic status, and location of the household in the region were the main predictors of daily mobility patterns. Activity spaces of small sizes centered on the residential neighborhood and implying a large volume of activities were associated with walking and/or biking as a transportation mode. Examination of patterns of spatial behavior by individual socio-demographic characteristics and in relation to transportation modes is useful to identify populations with specific mobility/accessibility needs and has implications for investigating transportation-related physical activity and assessing environmental exposures and their effects on health. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", 'Discrete choice in commuter space: Small area analysis of diurnal population change in the Tokyo Metropolitan Region[SEP]Considerations of metropolitan commuting have often related to urban space as a continuum, and to commuting itself as a process. This approach has led to escalating complexity in the measurement, modeling and analysis of commuting, often with no commensurate results. The present study extends an alternative approach that considers commuter space of a metropolis as a discrete set of small areas. Each small area throughout the metropolis is a nighttime location of some households and, as a possible discrete destination choice of individuals within households, each subarea is also a daytime location of some persons. Each subarea, therefore, may be thought of as attaining two values, corresponding to its daytime (e.g., noontime) and nighttime (e.g., midnight) populations. The diurnal demographic shift of subareas, as a set of binary events, or toggles, between daytime and nighttime populations, is associated with commuter access throughout the metropolis. Diurnal shift offers structural simplicity aimed at estimating small-area daytime populations across a metropolitan region that might suitably precede and complement conventional continuum considerations of commuting. Using data for the Tokyo Metropolitan Region, we identify average household size as the nighttime indicator of small-areas, and daytime population density as their daytime indicator. The potential for the estimation of daytime populations across metropolitan regions where daytime population data are unavailable, is underscored by the clear tendency towards inverse relation of these two indicators of diurnal shift. © 2012. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'An estimation of tourism dependence in French Rural Areas[SEP]Tourism activity is characterized by trips with an associated set of goods and services including lodging, transportation, food and beverage delivery, personal and recreation services. This economic sector is difficult to define precisely because some of the related activities are not used exclusively for tourism consumption (e.g., restaurants), and thus depend on the permanent vs. temporary population ratio. Though isolating tourism jobs is not easy, it is acknowledged that this \"quasi-sector\" plays an increasingly important role in the national economy, and is becoming strategic to the development of some areas. Such is the case of many rural areas where a shift away from traditional extractive and manufacturing activities has enhanced the role of hosting functions in general, tourism functions in particular, in local economic growth. On the demand side of rural tourism, there is an interest in nature and landscape attributes, which are associated with healthy and quiet living conditions. For instance, including environmental variables in hedonic pricing models shows an impact of site characteristics on the rental prices of rural lodging (Mollard et al. 2006). On the supply side, two models of the tourism firm are usually found in rural areas. One model uses significant low-skilled labour but little capital and technology, while adding value to fixed \"natural\" assets (Eadington and Redman 1991). This model matches rural entrepreneurship relatively well because it is based on family capital and labour and creates activities that suit farm diversification and household pluriactivity. A second, capital intensive, high-skilled labour model may be observed in \"specialized\" tourism resorts. Often found in mountain or seaside areas, this second model is relatively nonexistent in \"ordinary\" rural areas (except in leisure parks). Thus, the type of tourism developing in rural areas is mainly extensive and based on local natural features. From a regional development perspective, the analysis of this type of tourism involves three complementary dimensions: (i) conditional factors associated with public goods, (ii) setting up a consistent tourism offer, and (iii) domino effects on the local economy. First, rural tourism adds value to fixed assets that often have a local public good status. Nature goods are strictly localized; their development and protection management associates rights and uses for which the public sphere plays a major role. Moreover, tourism activity increases consumption of local public services and may require additional utility capacity to meet the needs of the permanent plus temporary population. These are not strict preconditions for the existence of tourism because a given level of under-development or isolation may attract pioneering activities. However, the development of a significant tourism activity requires that public services and local amenities be available and maintained. The second dimension pertains to how fragmented smaller projects add up to a consistent local offer. Contrary to resorts, which are planned and built in an integrated manner, rural tourism is made up of aggregated individual initiatives that more or less refer to a common context -a pays d\\'accueil touristique2 for instance. Indeed, the issue is to provide a full and consistent array of tourism activities. The supply of primary goods and services (such as lodging and recreation activities) may adjust through competition, but nothing guarantees the implementation of secondary functions (e.g., fairs) over a reasonable time range. Moreover, territorial cohesion implies that user conflicts over access to fixed assets have been solved. Consequently, there is a need for an overall regulation of the local tourism offer, and it is critical to define an appropriate scale for coordinating tourism initiatives. Third is the question of regional economic impacts of tourism activities. In addition to direct tourism jobs, indirect (in activities that have business relations with tourism activities per se) as well as induced (in sectors that benefit from increased demand due to higher local income in tourism activities) jobs must be taken into account. The analysis of indirect jobs requires input-output models to estimate intersectoral relation coefficients for every economic sector in contact with the tourism sector. The analysis of induced effects is based on the estimation of a multiplier that calculates demand changes in the residentiary sector after an exogenous shock changes income flows in the regional system.3 These two methods are sensitive to the size of the study region and to the degree of integration of the given economy (Vollet 1998). The objectives of the paper focus on identifying the importance of tourism activities in rural areas. First, tourism-related jobs have to be identified, then the level of tourism activity is analyzed with respect to both the role of natural resources and local growth. In order to take regional effects into account, the analysis is conducted at Functional Economic Area (FEA, bassin de vie) level. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 17.2 presents efforts to define rural tourism in the French and North American literatures. Section 17.3 presents data and methods. The results regarding FEA classification, tourism dependence and regional economic indicators are presented and discussed in Section 17.4.

However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Advancing geomarketing analyses with improved spatiotemporal distribution of population at high resolution[SEP]Knowing the spatiotemporal distribution of population at the local level is fundamental for many applications, including risk management, health and environmental studies, territorial planning and management, and GeoMarketing. Census figures register where people reside and usually sleep, and are frequently the only data source available for such analyses. Currently, the analysis of service areas and population served is mostly made considering only census data as source of population distribution, while some businesses clearly serve mostly a daytime population. However, population density is not constant within census enumeration areas. Also, due to human activities, population counts and their distribution vary widely from nighttime to daytime, especially in metropolitan areas, and this variation is not captured by census data. Raster dasymetric mapping within geographic modeling allows transforming raw population counts to population density limited to specific areas where the variable is present, in more detailed temporal periods, by using ancillary data sets and zonal interpolation. In GeoMarketing, this information is especially useful for retail sales, banking, insurance, lodging, real estate, and franchising. These refined distributions can be used to improve such analyses as site selection, service area and population served, assessment of potential markets, routing activities, location-allocation, and gravity models. This study uses such a dasymetric mapping approach for detailed modeling and mapping of the spatiotemporal distribution of population in the daily cycle. These data sets are used to assess the location and the varying population contained in the service areas of existing and prospective commercial facilities in the daily cycle, for different types of businesses. Applications in GeoMarketing using spatial analysis are illustrated for three different scenarios involving private sector services where maximizing coverage of target population is paramount for success. The case studies show that when the spatiotemporal distribution of population is considered, the obtained set of solutions differs from the one produced by using census-based data alone. The results demonstrate that enhancing population distribution data through geographical modeling can greatly benefit spatial analysis in GeoMarketing, resulting in the production of better information that ultimately allows improved decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Analysis of temporal changes in population distribution for developing cities using social survey data[SEP]Information about daily or hourly changes in population distribution is becoming increasingly important in business fields such as marketing and public services. In recent years, the prevalence of mobile phones has refined the data collection process; in certain countries, fragmentary data offered by mobile phone users are used to estimate and map the number of people in a certain area at any given time of a day. Such information would be potentially useful in cities of developing countries, where various infrastructure needs may not yet have been fully met. This study attempts to mimic the aforementioned process by using existing data from several such cities in order to examine how dynamic population distribution data could be used. Data are based on trip information from Person-Trip Surveys conducted by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and that have been reconstructed in order to identify the specific locations of people. Whereas past studies organized this information to represent the flow of people, this study attempts to clarify overall population distribution. Such visualization will help assist in the urban planning of cities, including establish what steps should be taken in the event of a natural disaster. Furthermore, implementing this method on various cities and comparing the results will help confirm what factors, cultural or otherwise, affect the temporal changes in urban population distribution.

         "[\"Towards improved risk assessment: Mapping the spatio-temporal distribution of human exposure to earthquake hazard in the Lisbon metropolitan area[SEP]Risk is a function of hazard probability and vulnerability, the latter resulting from a combination of exposure and ability to cope. However, assessment and mapping of human vulnerability has been lagging behind hazard analysis efforts. Furthermore, due to human activities and mobility, the spatial distribution of population is time-dependent, especially in metropolitan areas. Therefore more accurate estimation of population exposure and risk assessment requires moving beyond using simple residence-based census data. Lisbon, Portugal, is subject to significant risk of earthquake, which can strike at any day and time, as confirmed by modern history. The recently-approved 'Special Emergency and Civil Protection Plan' is based on a Seismic Intensity map, and only considers resident population from the census as human exposure. In the present work we map and analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of population in the daily cycle to re-assess earthquake risk in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. New high-resolution daytime and nighttime population distribution maps are developed using 'intelligent dasymetric mapping', i.e. using areal interpolation to combine best-available census data and statistics with land use and land cover data. Mobility statistics are considered for mapping daytime distribution, and empirical parameters used for interpolation are obtained from a previous modeling effort of part of the study area. Finally, the population distribution maps are combined with the Seismic Hazard Intensity map to assess potential exposure and produce new daytime and nighttime overall Seismic Risk maps.

These are time-specific events, and despite directly affecting a narrow strip of coastline, a single occurrence can have devastating effects and cause massive loss of life, especially in urbanized coastal areas. In this work, in order to consider the time dependence of population exposure to tsunami threat, the variation of spatio-temporal population distribution in the daily cycle is mapped and analyzed in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. High-resolution daytime and nighttime population distribution maps are developed using 'intelligent dasymetric mapping,' that is, applying areal interpolation to combine best-available census data and statistics with land use and land cover data.

The detailed dynamic population exposure assessment allows producing both daytime and nighttime evacuation time maps, which provide valuable input for evacuation planning and management. Results show that a significant amount of population is at risk, and its numbers increase dramatically from nighttime to daytime, especially in the zones of high tsunami flooding susceptibility. Also, full evacuation can be problematic in the daytime period, even if initiated immediately after a major tsunami-triggering earthquake.

Three conceptually different population estimates can be used: de jure (common census, residence), de facto (all persons within a sewer catchment), and chemical loads (contributors to the sampled wastewater). De facto and chemical loads will be the same where all households contribute to a central sewer system without wastewater loss. This study explored the feasibility of determining a de facto population and its effect on estimating PNDC in an urban community over an extended period. Drugs and other chemicals were analyzed in 311 daily composite wastewater samples. The daily estimated de facto population (using chemical loads) was on average 32% higher than the de jure population. Consequently, using the latter would systemically overestimate PNDC by 22%. However, the relative day-to-day pattern of drug consumption was similar regardless of the type of normalization as daily illicit drug loads appeared to vary substantially more than the population. Using chemical loads population, we objectively quantified the total methodological uncertainty of PNDC and reduced it by a factor of 2. Our study illustrated the potential benefits of using chemical loads population for obtaining more robust PNDC data in WBDE.

The primary driving force for managing and regulating distribution systems is to provide potable drinking water. Water distribution systems are inherently vulnerable to accidental or intentional contamination because of their distributed geography and numerous access points. The objective of a contamination warning system (CWS) is to minimize potential economic and public health impacts resulting from either an accidental release (such as a chemical spill) or a deliberate act of terrorism. Accidental or malicious introduction of a contaminant into water distribution systems could potentially have severe health effects on a population. Such intrusions can potentially be detected by deploying a number of sensing devices into the water distribution system. Optimal sensor placement needs to reflect variation in the timing of a contamination event and the distribution of the affected population. Population varies temporally (day versus night time) and spatially (different areas within city). The temporal population variation is not currently accounted for in sensor design studies. Previous studies of optimal sensor placement to support CWS design have considered only spatial variability using U.S. Census data or demand-based population models. This study included temporal variability by analyzing both day and night time population data. This was accomplished by using multiple population data sources such as LandScan and U.S. Census as input to the Threat Ensemble Vulnerability Assessment Sensor Placement Optimization Tool (TEVA-SPOT). This study showed that the temporal variation in population has a significant impact on sensor network design. © 2012 ASCE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'A model to estimate the population contributing to the wastewater using samples collected on census day[SEP]An important uncertainty when estimating per capita consumption of, for example, illicit drugs by means of wastewater analysis (sometimes referred to as \"sewage epidemiology\") relates to the size and variability of the de facto population in the catchment of interest. In the absence of a day-specific direct population count any indirect surrogate model to estimate population size lacks a standard to assess associated uncertainties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collect wastewater samples at a unique opportunity, that is, on a census day, as a basis for a model to estimate the number of people contributing to a given wastewater sample. Mass loads for a wide range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products were quantified in influents of ten sewage treatment plants (STP) serving populations ranging from approximately 3500 to 500 000 people. Separate linear models for population size were estimated with the mass loads of the different chemical as the explanatory variable: 14 chemicals showed good, linear relationships, with highest correlations for acesulfame and gabapentin. De facto population was then estimated through Bayesian inference, by updating the population size provided by STP staff (prior knowledge) with measured chemical mass loads. Cross validation showed that large populations can be estimated fairly accurately with a few chemical mass loads quantified from 24-h composite samples. In contrast, the prior knowledge for small population sizes cannot be improved substantially despite the information of multiple chemical mass loads. In the future, observations other than chemical mass loads may improve this deficit, since Bayesian inference allows including any kind of information relating to population size. © 2013 American Chemical Society. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

In this paper, we start instead to explore economies where the payoff landscape is very complicated (rugged). We propose a model where the payoff to any agent changes in an unpredictable way as soon as any small variation in the strategy configuration within its network occurs. We study population learning where agents: (i) are allowed to periodically adjust both the strategy they play in the game and their interaction network; (ii) employ some simple criteria (e.g. statistics such as MIN, MAX, MEAN, etc.) to myopically form expectations about their payoff under alternative strategy and network configurations. Computer simulations show that: (i) allowing for endogenous networks implies higher average payoff as compared to static networks; (ii) populations learn by employing network updating as a \"global learning\" device, while strategy updating is used to perform \"fine tuning\"; (iii) the statistics employed to evaluate payoffs strongly affect the efficiency of the system, i.e. convergence to a unique (multiple) steady-state(s); (iv) for some class of statistics (e.g. MIN or MAX), the likelihood of efficient population learning strongly depends on whether agents are change-averse in discriminating between options associated to the same expected payoff. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Complex agent network model for the competition among three languages[SEP]This paper proposes a dynamic social network model for the competition among three languages with agent based social circles modeling method. The parameters of the topological structure of constructed social network are closer to parameters of the actual social network, and the parameters of social network can be adjusted by setting the different social radius of the individual agents. The individual agents on the network can move, dead and reproduce, so the constructed social network is endowed with dynamic characteristics. The model for the competition between two languages of agent nodes in the language competition network is extended to the competition among three languages model of agent nodes in the language competition network. Finally we constructed a complex agent network simulation model for the competition among three languages.

Estimation techniques typically involve cloning or matching households in surveys with small-area census data. When model estimates are benchmarked against real-world data, the models are typically well behaved and very robust, but they can struggle to capture the diversity of spatial variations shown by observed data. We argue in this paper that this is the result of 3 potential problems in spatial microsimulation estimation techniques. The first issue results from the matching process in the estimation techniques, and the second problem relates to the variations of household types in the surveys being reweighted. Third, similar household types may show different behaviours or have different attributes depending on geographical factors not contained in surveys (such as the proximity of service or job locations). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and measure the loss of accuracy and intensity induced by spatial microsimulation in the context of real individual data. It will be argued in particular that while the first two problems have begun to be addressed in the literature, the third issue is still largely unreported. The paper will thus suggest a solution framework which involves linking spatial microsimulation models with geodemographics and demonstrates the promise of this technique with real numerical experiments. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Community-Wide Health Risk Assessment Using Geographically Resolved Demographic Data: A Synthetic Population Approach[SEP]Background: Evaluating environmental health risks in communities requires models characterizing geographic and demographic patterns of exposure to multiple stressors. These exposure models can be constructed from multivariable regression analyses using individual-level predictors (microdata), but these microdata are not typically available with sufficient geographic resolution for community risk analyses given privacy concerns. Methods: We developed synthetic geographically-resolved microdata for a low-income community (New Bedford, Massachusetts) facing multiple environmental stressors. We first applied probabilistic reweighting using simulated annealing to data from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, combining 9,135 microdata samples from the New Bedford area with census tract-level constraints for individual and household characteristics. We then evaluated the synthetic microdata using goodness-of-fit tests and by examining spatial patterns of microdata fields not used as constraints. As a demonstration, we developed a multivariable regression model predicting smoking behavior as a function of individual-level microdata fields using New Bedford-specific data from the 2006-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, linking this model with the synthetic microdata to predict demographic and geographic smoking patterns in New Bedford. Results: Our simulation produced microdata representing all 94,944 individuals living in New Bedford in 2006-2010. Variables in the synthetic population matched the constraints well at the census tract level (e. g., ancestry, gender, age, education, household income) and reproduced the census-derived spatial patterns of non-constraint microdata. Smoking in New Bedford was significantly associated with numerous demographic variables found in the microdata, with estimated tract-level smoking rates varying from 20% (95% CI: 17%, 22%) to 37% (95% CI: 30%, 45%). Conclusions: We used simulation methods to create geographically-resolved individual-level microdata that can be used in community-wide exposure and risk assessment studies. This approach provides insights regarding community-scale exposure and vulnerability patterns, valuable in settings where policy can be informed by characterization of multi-stressor exposures and health risks at high resolution.', 'A review of current methods to generate synthetic spatial microdata using reweighting and future directions[SEP]Synthetic spatial microdata enable analyses of artificial populations in the form of individual unit record files at a small area level. They allow analyses of estimates of variables that are otherwise not available at this small area level, while preserving the confidentiality of personal data. This type of data has mainly been used to provide more detailed census data and for spatial microsimulation modelling: for example to analyse social policy and population changes, transportation, marketing strategies or health outcomes. We argue that many potential applications for synthetic spatial microdata remain to be developed. One reason for this is the lack of information about and confidence in this type of data. Introductory literature about creating synthetic spatial microdata and discussions on the decisions that need to be taken during the data generation process are rare. In this paper, we therefore review currently existing methods to generate synthetic spatial microdata in a manner which will support most readers who are considering this approach, and we address the main issues of the data generation process with regards to analyses of neighbourhood level data. We discuss further possible applications of these data and the importance of synthetic spatial microdata. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

         "['Climate change is associated with a higher extinction risk of a subshrub in anthropogenic landscapes[SEP]In most ecosystems, the increasingly strong effects of climate change on biodiversity co-occur with other anthropogenic pressures, most importantly land-use change. However, many long-term demographic studies focus on populations monitored in protected areas, and our understanding of how climate change will affect population persistence under anthropogenic land use is still limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the consequences of co-occurring land-use and climate change on vital rates and population dynamics of a fire-adapted Mediterranean carnivorous subshrub, the dewy pine (Drosophyllum lusitanicum). We used 7 years of individual data on 4753 plants monitored in three natural heathland sites that experience primarily fire as a disturbance, and five anthropogenic sites, where fires have been replaced by persistent disturbances from browsing or mechanical vegetation removal as a consequence of land-use change. All sites are projected to experience increasingly hotter summers and drier falls and winters. We used generalised additive models to model non-linear responses of survival, growth and reproduction to rainfall, temperature, size, density and time since fire in anthropogenic and natural dewy-pine populations. We then projected population dynamics under climate-change scenarios using an individual-based model. Our findings reveal that vital rates respond differently to climate change in anthropogenic compared to natural habitats. While extinction risks did not change under climate change in natural habitats, future higher summer temperatures decreased survival and led to population declines and higher extinction probabilities in anthropogenic habitats. Synthesis. Our results highlight the possible dramatic effects of climate change on populations largely confined to chronically disturbed, anthropogenic habitats and provide a foundation for devising relevant management strategies aiming towards the protection of species in human-disturbed habitats of the Mediterranean habitat. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for more long-term studies in managed landscapes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Developing service-based web application for determining waste bin locations[SEP]Solid waste has become one of the critical problems of today’s cities due to rapid population growth and uncontrolled urbanization. In urban waste management, waste bins are placed inefficiently and collection routes are often determined manually. This situation increases operating costs and causes some environmental and sociological problems. In this study, a web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application was developed that optimizes the locations of waste bins and determines the routes to transfer waste from these bins to transfer stations or disposal facilities for urban waste management. For the developed Web-GIS application, some scripts were designed in Python language that use real-time population data to optimize the locations of waste bins. ArcGIS Network Analyst Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) tool was also used to determine the routes. The developed application aims to improve the efficiency of waste collection operations by optimizing bin placement and reducing travel distance. The developed application was tested in a region of the Ortahisar district in Trabzon/Türkiye where different scenarios can be evaluated. According to the results of the pilot region study, travel distance improved by 12.4% and operation time improved by approximately 44.58% compared to the current situation. It is evaluated that these improvements will also reduce carbon emissions and waste management costs. Additionally, this application can be scaled and adapted for use in other urban areas facing similar waste management challenges. Implications: The Solid Waste Management System (SWMS) has been developed to accurately collect and dispose of waste, addressing the mentioned problems. The SWMS offers the benefit of automating all activities from waste collection to disposal. This study aims to create a web-based application for SWMS to identify the most suitable locations for waste bins and routes to transfer solid waste from these bins to transfer stations or disposal facilities. As a result of the studies, it was determined that significant improvements could be made in route length, collection time and workforce, and that waste bins could be placed more efficiently. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Temporary Mobility and Population Pulsations in Space of Post-Soviet Russia[SEP]Abstract—: The paper summarizes recent studies by Russian researchers on various types of temporary mobility and related population pulsations. It is shown that the practice of their study in Russia is in line with the key areas of research on the spatiotemporal population dynamics currently developing abroad. The methodology of work commuting studies is enriched, the first research studies on the event-related mobilities tend to appear. Forms of mobility specific to Russia are also being actively studied, including dacha migration (in many respects close to migration to second homes widespread abroad) and otkhodnichestvo. In addition to objective trends associated with the growth of population mobility, the rapid growth of research interest stems from the expansion of information and the resource base on temporary mobility, including agricultural census materials, mobile network operators’ data, interpretation of satellite images, etc. The review of certain types of mobility provides estimates of the scale of their distribution in Russia, intensity, and rhythmic patterns and summarizes key factors (spatial, social, labor, etc.). The content of the approaches used by Russian authors is revealed, the results obtained by referring to special methods of seasonal mobility and the mechanisms of its dynamics are given. The main directions, methodological barriers, and challenges of future studies of mobility and pulsations, including the need to research territories with the greatest intensity of temporary mobility, have been identified. The potential for using methods to analyze temporal population pulsations in relation to the spatiotemporal variability of settlement systems is shown. In particular, the case of the Moscow metropolitan region demonstrates the basic laws of polyrhythmic pulsation mechanisms, leading to maximum variability (involving up to 40% of the permanent population). The theory of population pulsations is at the formation stage: despite the development of the first models of pulsating settlement systems, including the pulsating urban agglomeration model, many of their quantitative parameters still remain infor-mal. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

         "[\"A methodology to prioritize spatio-temporal monitoring of drinking water quality considering population vulnerability[SEP]The optimization of drinking water monitoring becomes increasingly complex with the size of a water distribution system. Municipal water managers have to combine their experiences with different types of information (historical water quality variability, infrastructure, water residence times, sociodemographic profiles, etc.) that are available in different forms (qualitative, quantitative, geographical, etc.) to be able to select the monitoring locations for regulatory compliance and routine water quality management and control. Therefore, the integration of such information requires to select suitable variables and use the appropriate data mining and aggregation methods. This work aims to develop a methodology that helps optimize drinking water quality monitoring programs by considering the different components of population vulnerability that vary both spatially and temporally. This project was conducted in a distribution system that supplies approximately 510 000 citizens. Due to the high seasonal climatic variations and the size of the network, there are also considerable spatial and temporal variations in water quality throughout the year. An index representing the spatio-temporal population vulnerability (combination of population exposure, sensitivity and adaptation capacity) to the degradation of drinking water quality was developed by selecting the relevant parameters and aggregation methods. The population vulnerability index was calculated by aggregating spatio-temporal water quality data (representing microbiological and chemical risks) and distribution network characteristics (number of leakages, pipes type and age). This information was then compared with sociodemographic data related to population sensitivity (percentage of children and the elderly, and the number of health care centers) and the population's adaptive capacity (social and material deprivation). A fuzzy synthetic evaluation method is used for parameter aggregation and to calculate the different indexes. By considering variable locations and periods of time that may better represent the population vulnerability, the results of this project are useful for drinking water managers to optimize their drinking water monitoring strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", 'Future potable water supply demand projection under climate change and socioeconomic scenarios: A case of Gshba subbasin, Northern Ethiopia[SEP]This paper aims to quantify the subbasin’s potable water supply demand forecast from 2023 to 2050 under various scenarios of climate change and socioeconomic development. The variability of the climate and the resulting problems with urbanization threaten the availability of water resources, especially in less developed countries like Ethiopia. Thus, the main objective of this study is showing the necessary to determine the amount of water needed in advance, in order to comply with the availability of water resources within a specified future period under different scenarios. Our indicator-based approach used a multicriteria decision-making technique. Accordingly, several important variables were considered, including climatological, anthropological, demographic, socioeconomic, and economic variables, in addition to water engineering-related factors (e.g. Water losses). The method also considered a number of factors, such as unexpected and extreme temperature changes, and forecasting factors studied by the Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy. The projected population in the subbasin is estimated at 2.52 million, so the total projected water supply demand i.e., for domestic, non-domestic, industrial, commercial, public, and institutional is approximately 126.53 MCM/yr by 2050. Our results revealed how changes in both climatic and socioeconomic factors strongly influence future water resource system performance, and this will help the water services provider better prioritize the refurbishment of existing infrastructure and investment in new infrastructure, and more importantly, manage the subbasin effectively by introducing resilient adaptation options. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'An evaluation of the relationship between urban resilience and urban regeneration based on urban density and social infrastructure value: The case of Kayseri[SEP]Since the turn of the century, there have been significant changes in the field of planning and in the practices carried out for the sake of urban regeneration in Turkey that merit analysis. The most important of these changes are represented by urban regeneration projects introduced to mitigate disaster risk and increasing the quality of urban life. Urban regeneration projects in Turkey continue to develop through segmental plan changes that lack scientific justification. This type of approach not only leads to population growth exceeding the figures predicted in the upper scale plan decisions of the city but also reduces the green areas, education and health infrastructure, social facilities, and cultural facilities associated with population growth. This pattern tends to compel people to live in a city where the quality of urban life has declined. Increasing population density through segmental and project-based urban regeneration prac-tices and deteriorating social due to density are the main reasons behind the diminished resil-ience of urban systems. This paper analyses the relationship between urban resilience and urban regeneration based on a field study conducted in Kayseri. The study examines the problems of increased urban density and the incompatibility of the social infrastructure (in terms of adequacy and location). To this end, all areas defined as highly risky between 2012 and 2020 in Kayseri in accordance with the Law on the Transformation of Areas under Disaster Risk No.6306 were analysed. Within the scope of the study, we examined the construction plan and plan expla-nation reports and found a population growth rate by comparing the population figures before and after the implementation of the transformation plan. Then we assessed how the population density increase reflects on the building density increase based on the precedent/ building density change. From the plan explanation report, we obtained the change in the overall social infrastructure ratio brought about by population growth and examined this figure on the basis of m(2) per capita. In the examined projects, an average 47% increase was noted in the local population as a result of the plans, with the highest increase being 84%. In addition, an average 2.08 times increase was witnessed in building density, with the highest increase being eight-fold. As for social in-frastructure areas, the average decrease in the square meters per capita was 20% in the studied projects, with the the most significant drop being 38%. While 40% of the social infrastructure areas in the projects were preserved, 10% were completely removed, and new proposals were made. Furthermore, 40% underwent a partial change in either size or location, and no new proposals were made in the remaining 10% of the social infrastructure areas. These findings indicate that the maintenance of standards, mitigation of risk and provision of urban resilience, which are the main objectives of the Disaster Law, have not been largely achieved. Deterioration of the standards for social infrastructure area together with the increase in population and building density rates and changes in their function or location properties create open area inadequacy risks in areas to be used as a potential assembly and discharge point in possible disasters and states of emergency. These developments also mean new risk levels depending on different usage incompatibilities in areas such as the city centre (Sahabiye Phase 1 and 2 projects) and industrial zone (Anbar project area), which have higher development and daytime population utilisation density rates. In addition, various threats such as the problems that may be caused by potential building demolitions and night/day population differences may cause urban texture risks, which can have an impact on the vulnerability of urban infrastructure. When open and green areas within the social infrastructure areas are associated with building density and building order within the dense urban texture and are designed with sufficient vegetation, there may also be advantages in terms of air circulation, the feeding of underground water resources during precipitation, and reducing the urban heat island effect in extreme temperatures. However, the above-mentioned adverse factors lead to a decrease in the adaptation capacity of cities in the face of possible disturbances. The resilience of cities will gradually decrease if risk reduction is understood and implemented based only on the market mechanism in high-risk areas and with an approach that only increases urban density. This research offers substantial insight into the emerging problems and adaptation capacities of cities by analysing the relationship between urban regeneration and urban resilience based on the findings of a field study, which represents the original value of the study.']"

Based on China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) in 2014, 1145 samples with their settlement intention, hukou transfer intention, individual demographic characteristics, urban working and living conditions, rural resources and attachment, and geographic characteristics were collected. It suggested that compared with settlement intention, the rural migrants' hukou transfer intention were much weaker. The rural migrants preferred small and medium cities for urban settlement but large and megacities for urban hukou conversion. By logistic regression analysis, a set of complex determinants of settlement intention was identified, including age, education attainment, marital status and spouse living together, as well as the trade-off between urban working and living conditions in the current host cities and rural landholdings and attachment in the hometown. In contrast, the hukou transfer intention was mainly determined by age, personal income, rural landholdings and the size of current host city, which highlighted the personal citizenization capacity and the trade-off between benefits related to urban and rural hukou. Moreover, by examining the characteristics of four sub-types of rural migrants with different settlement intention and hukou transfer intention, it was found that the rural migrants who intended to settle down and convert hukou at the same time usually had high personal citizenization capacity and preferred megacities; those who intended to settle down but rejected hukou conversion usually had high citizenization capacity and low migration cost; those who intended to convert hukou but rejected settling down in the cites preferred megacities instead of small cities; those who did not intend to settle down or convert hukou at all usually had low citizenization capacity and high migration cost. Based on these findings, it is recommended to promote the complete citizenization of rural migrants by improving their livelihood and well-being in the cities through kinds of policy reform about hukou, land, and social insurance.\", \"Welfare migration or migrant selection? Social insurance participation and rural migrants' intentions to seek permanent urban settlement in China[SEP]The welfare system can be a crucial factor in the urban settlement of rural migrants, but its effects are difficult to determine because to do so one must distinguish the effect of welfare entitlement from the effect of 'migrant selectivity bias', which widely exists in cities in developing countries. Using survey data from 15 Chinese cities, this study examines the ways in which social insurance - the most critical social welfare package in China - affects rural migrants' urban-settlement intentions. The results show that there is a 'migrant selectivity bias' in Chinese cities, that is, rural migrants who are better off socio-economically are more inclined to participate in social insurance and are more inclined to pursue permanent urban settlement. Meanwhile, social insurance participation is significantly and positively related to rural migrants' urban-settlement intentions, and this positive relation remains even after we discount the effect of 'migrant selectivity bias' in the analysis. We argue that, for rural migrants in China, the effect of social insurance participation on urban settlement intentions closely resembles that experienced by those who move to migration-managed regimes. We conclude that the Chinese government should establish a more inclusive social welfare system to enable rural migrants to permanently settle in cities.\", \"Access to social insurance in urban China: A comparative study of rural-urban and urban-urban migrants in Beijing[SEP]Since 1958 the hukou (household registration) system has assigned Chinese citizens either a rural or urban status. Some studies argue that the rural-to-urban migrants in China who do not have urban hukou are not entitled to urban social insurance schemes, due to institutional discrimination, which applies differing treatment to urban and rural hukou (chengxiang fenge). Although rural-urban migrants participate less in the social insurance system than their counterparts with urban hukou, a closer examination of recent policy developments shows that migrants actually do have the legal right to access the system. This implies that discrimination between rural and urban workers has been declining, and distinctions based on household registration status are less able to explain China's current urban transition. This paper provides a new way of examining Chinese migrants' social insurance participation, by adopting a framework that includes both rural-to-urban migrants and urban-to-urban migrants, which are an important, but less studied, migrant group. Among our key findings are that urban migrants are more likely to sign a labour contract than rural migrants; urban migrants have higher participation rates in social insurance than rural migrants; having a labour contract has a greater impact than hukou status in determining whether Beijing's floating population accesses social insurance; and urban migrants who have signed a labour contract have higher participation rates in social insurance than either rural migrants or urban migrants without a labour contract. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\"]"

         "['Untangling the interplay between epidemic spread and transmission network dynamics[SEP]The epidemic spread of infectious diseases is ubiquitous and often has a considerable impact on public health and economic wealth. The large variability in the spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics prohibits simple interventions and requires a detailed analysis of each epidemic with respect to its infectious agent and the corresponding routes of transmission. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a mathematical framework which links epidemic patterns to the topology and dynamics of the underlying transmission network. The evolution, both in disease prevalence and transmission network topology, is derived from a closed set of partial differential equations for infections without allowing for recovery. The predictions are in excellent agreement with complementarily conducted agent-based simulations. The capacity of this new method is demonstrated in several case studies on HIV epidemics in synthetic populations: it allows us to monitor the evolution of contact behavior among healthy and infected individuals and the contributions of different disease stages to the spreading of the epidemic. This gives both direction to and a test bed for targeted intervention strategies for epidemic control. In conclusion, this mathematical framework provides a capable toolbox for the analysis of epidemics from first principles. This allows for fast, in silico modeling - and manipulation - of epidemics and is especially powerful if complemented with adequate empirical data for parameterization. © 2010 Christel Kamp. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Part II: Dynamic evolution of the particle size distribution in particulate processes undergoing simultaneous particle nucleation, growth and aggregation[SEP]The present study provides a comprehensive investigation on the solution of the dynamic population balance equation (PBE) for particulate processes undergoing simultaneous particle nucleation, growth and aggregation. The general PBE was numerically solved in both the continuous and its equivalent discrete form using the orthogonal collocation on finite elements and the discretized PBE method, respectively. A detailed investigation on the effect of particle nucleation rate on the calculated particle size distribution (PSD) was carried out over a wide range of variation of dimensionless aggregation, nucleation and growth times. The performance (i.e., accuracy and stability) of the two numerical methods was assessed by a direct comparison of predicted PSDs and/or their respective moments to available analytical solutions. For combined aggregation and nucleation problems, the numerical error scaled with the product of the dimensionless aggregation and nucleation times. On the other hand, for combined growth and nucleation problems, the numerical error scaled only with the dimensionless growth time. For particulate systems with minimal particle growth, constant particle nucleation rate and Brownian aggregation, the total particle number approached a \"steady-state\" value characterized by the equilibrium of particle aggregation and nucleation rates. When the particle nucleation rate followed a pulse-like function, the PSD converged to a self-similar distribution after the end of particle nucleation. Moreover, for particulate systems exhibiting a constant particle nucleation rate and a Brownian-type particle aggregation kernel, an increase in the particle growth rate resulted in a decrease in the final total number of particles. On the other hand, for a constant particle nucleation rate and an electrostatically stabilized Brownian aggregation kernel, an increase in the particle growth rate can lead to an increase in the final total number of particles. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of continuous flow processes, numerical simulations were carried out till the dynamic solution reached its final steady-state. It was found that the calculated PSDs converged exactly to available analytical steady-state solutions of the PBE. The transient PSDs were often characterized by steep moving fronts that required careful discretization of the particle volume domain and the inclusion of an artificial diffusion term in order to eliminate numerical oscillations in the solution.

Previous studies have mainly focused on species borders and C-M process in natural settings for native species. More recently, growing efforts are devoted to examine the C-M patterns and process for invasive species partly due to their relatively short history, highly dynamic populations, and management implications. Here I examine recent findings and information gaps related to (1) the C-M population dynamics linked to species invasions, and (2) the possible effects of climate change and land use on the C-M patterns and processes. Unlike most native species that are relatively stable (some even having contracting populations or ranges), many invasive species are still spreading fast and form new distribution or abundance centers. Because of the strong nonlinearity of population demographic or vital rates (i.e., birth, death, immigration, and emigration) across the C-M gradients and the increased complexity of species ranges due to habitat fragmentation, multiple introductions, range-wide C-M comparisons and simulation involving multiple vital rates are needed in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\", 'Population viability and species interactions: Life outside the single-species vacuum[SEP]Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a widely used set of tools for evaluating relative extinction risk and prioritizing management options among imperiled populations. While PVA is a widely sanctioned tool in conservation biology, the field of population viability is in its infancy with respect to species interactions. In this paper, I review available methods for evaluating extinction risk when species interactions contribute significantly to population viability. This review includes an evaluation of six broad categories of species interactions (predation, disease, competition, mutualism, parasitism and host-parasitoid interactions) in population viability analysis, with a particular focus on predation as a case study. I first evaluated how often species interactions are considered when PVA is applied to population data from imperiled species. I identified 378 articles in commonly cited conservation journals, of which 24 attempted a viability analysis for populations threatened by interactions with other species. Most of these PVA\\'s treat a putative species interaction as a constant source of mortality rather than a coupled, dynamic population process. Second, I reviewed the literature to identify the availability of time-series of abundance data for two interacting species in which at least one species was threatened or endangered. Adequate time-series data were available for both species comprising an interacting pair in only 9 out of 407 papers reviewed. Third, I used a stochastic, fully stage-structured predator prey model to create time-series data (vital rates and projection matrices) in order to quantify the efficacy of two matrix-based, single-species PVA approaches. Simple single-species PVAs confound stochastic variation with population cycles induced by species interactions (in this case predation). As a result these models provide conservatively biased forecasts of viability. Unfortunately, the data needed to construct more complex PVA\\'s with feedback and multi-species stochasticity are rarely collected. I close with a discussion of key advances needed to \"escape the population vacuum\" in a move toward more realistic estimates of extinction risk. © 2007. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Incorporating species population dynamics into static prioritization: Targeting species undergoing rapid change[SEP]Conservation planning has generally used models with a static spatial distribution of species to predict the likely occurrence of species. However, static data do not usually capture rapid changes in the abundance of endangered species or cryptic life stages such as the dormancy stage of eggs and seeds. Little is known about how neglecting dynamic population processes, such as recovery processes, can affect the outcomes of spatial prioritization in conservation planning. In this study, we investigated the distribution of 62 aquatic plant species, including 23 threatened species, in 415 agricultural ponds for 37 years to examine the importance of including recovery processes in conservation planning. Using long-term historical presence–absence data and seedbank longevity data for aquatic macrophytes, we estimated rates of population disappearance and recovery for each species in each pond over the next 100 years. Average rates of recovery exceeded 0, 0.2, and 0.4 in 85.4%, 40.3%, and 4.8% of aquatic plant species, respectively. Simulation results suggested that the extinction risk for a species greatly decreased when recovery processes were considered. We found that including recovery processes in target species populations increased the performance of spatial prioritization by protecting more species in a smaller number of protected ponds. Spatial ranking of ponds for species conservation differed substantially among scenarios that included and excluded population recovery processes, suggesting that conservation priorities based on complementarity analysis are sensitive to underlying assumptions. Synthesis and applications. Our dynamic approach, which considers recovery processes of species, contributes to more effective conservation planning by reducing bias in the prediction of species’ state, given that cryptic life stages are ubiquitous among many plants and some animals. Time-series presence/absence data on target species are quite useful for the approach and are often archived by participatory monitoring. Thus, the opportunities for applying our method are broad, especially for conservation prioritization and decision-making at the local scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

Researchers have made some improvements especially in force rules and population topologies. However, the current algorithms only consider a single kind of force rules and lack consideration of comprehensive improvement in both multi force rules and population topologies. In this paper, a dynamic topology multi force particle swarm optimization (DTMFPSO) algorithm is proposed in order to get better search performance. First of all, the principle of the presented multi force particle swarm optimization (MFPSO) algorithm is that different force rules are used in different search stages, which can balance the ability of global and local search. Secondly, a fitness-driven edge-changing (FE) topology based on the probability selection mechanism of roulette method is designed to cut and add edges between the particles, and the DTMFPSO algorithm is proposed by combining the FE topology with the MFPSO algorithm through concurrent evolution of both algorithm and structure in order to further improve the search accuracy. Thirdly, Benchmark functions are employed to evaluate the performance of the DTMFPSO algorithm, and test results show that the proposed algorithm is better than the well-known PSO algorithms, such as μPSO, MPSO, and EPSO algorithms. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to optimize the process parameters for ultrasonic vibration cutting on SiC wafer, and the surface quality of the SiC wafer is improved by 12.8% compared with the PSO algorithm in Ref. [25]. This research proposes a DTMFPSO algorithm with multi force rules and dynamic population topologies evolved simultaneously, and it has better search performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Dynamic Population Synergy[SEP]Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms have been successfully applied to all kinds of optimization problems. However, the standard PSO algorithm can easily fall into local optimal regions when solving complex problems. It is difficult for the particles to get out of these regions, resulting in the inability to obtain the global optimal solution. This paper proposes a dynamic population synergy particle swarm optimization algorithm (DPSPSO) to solve the above problem. The DPSPSO algorithm dynamically divides the population into three sub-populations based on the function-adapted value ordering strategy. Each sub-population has a different task depending on its potential. Moreover, the algorithm employs an integrated learning strategy. This strategy aims to fully utilize the practical information provided by the particles to prevent premature convergence of the particles. Finally, this paper compares the proposed algorithm with five state-of-the-art PSO variants on the CEC2022 test function to investigate the algorithm’s effectiveness. The experimental results show that DPSPSO can achieve competitive performance compared to the other PSO variants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Dynamic Population Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization for Global Optimization Problems[SEP]Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has attracted wide attention in the recent decade. Although PSO is an efficient and simple evolutionary algorithm and has been successfully applied to solve optimization problems in many real-world fields, premature maturation and poor local search capability remain two critical issues for PSO. Therefore, to alleviate these disadvantages, a dynamic population cooperative particle swarm optimization for global optimization problems (DPCPSO) is proposed. Firstly, to enhance local search capability, an elite neighborhood learning strategy is constructed by leveraging information from elite particles. Meanwhile, to make the particle easily jump out of the local optimum, a crossover-mutation mechanism is utilized. Finally, a dynamic population partitioning mechanism is designed to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. 16 classic benchmark functions and 1 real-world optimization problem are used to test the proposed algorithm against with 6 typical PSO algorithms. The experimental results show that DPCPSO is statistically and significantly better than the compared algorithms for most of the test problems. Moreover, the convergence speed and convergence accuracy of DPCPSO are also significantly improved. Therefore, the algorithm is highly competitive in solving global optimization problems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

Impact of host star metallicity on planet occurrence rates, orbital periods, eccentricities, and radius valley morphology[SEP]Context. The dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disc, which is likely imprinted into the host star metallicity, is a property that plays a crucial role during planet formation. On the observational side, statistical studies based on large exoplanet datasets have determined various correlations between planetary characteristics and host star metallicity. Aims. We aim to constrain planet formation and evolution processes by statistically analysing planetary systems produced at different metallicities by a theoretical model, and we compare them with the correlations derived from observational samples. Methods. We used the Generation III Bern model of planet formation and evolution to generate synthetic planetary systems at different metallicities. This global model incorporates the accretion of planetesimals and gas, planetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, giant impacts, and protoplanetary disc evolution, as well as the planets’ long-term contraction and atmospheric loss of gaseous envelopes. Using synthetic planets biased to observational completeness, we analysed the impact of stellar metallicity on planet occurrence rates, orbital periods, eccentricities, and the morphology of the radius valley. Results. Based on our nominal model, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and Neptune-sized planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small sub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, at radii of 1 to 3.5 R, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with increasing [Fe/H], with an inflection point at ∼0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital periods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with a higher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius. (3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between the eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation and perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and becomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the planets above the valley (2.1–6 R) increases with [Fe/H]. Conclusions. Our nominal model successfully reproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity either quantitatively or qualitatively, and supports the description of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model. Quantitatively, the dependence of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted by the synthetic population, however, is significantly weaker than observed. This discrepancy likely arises because the model only accounts for planetary interactions for the first 100 Myr and neglects the effects of the stellar environment (e.g. clusters, binaries). This suggests that long-term dynamical interactions between planets, along with the impact of binaries and/or companions, can drive the system towards a dynamically hotter state. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS): IV. Planetary systems around low-mass stars[SEP]Context. Previous theoretical works on planet formation around low-mass stars have often been limited to large planets and individual systems. As current surveys routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, models have shifted toward a more holistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures. Aims. Here, we investigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in the statistical distribution of modeled planets. We compare the synthetic planet populations to observed exoplanets and we discuss the identified trends. Methods. We used the Generation III Bern global model of planet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations, while varying the central star from Solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes planetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, accretion of planetesimals and gas, and the long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous atmospheres. Results. We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs (0.3 M-0.5 M) and that they are more rare for Solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The reason behind this is attributed to the emergence of giant planets for M? - 0:5 M, which leads to the ejection of smaller planets. Given a linear scaling of the disk mass with stellar mass, the formation of Earth-like planets is limited by the available amount of solids for ultra-late M dwarfs. For M? - 0:3 M, however, there is sufficient mass in the majority of systems, leading to a similar amount of Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs, such as GJ 3512b, only form when type I migration is substantially reduced. Conclusions. We are able to quantify the stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of planet formation and evolution. The results fare well in comparison to current observational data and predict trends that can be tested with future observations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Magnetic and tidal migration of close-in planets: Influence of secular evolution on their population[SEP]Context. Over the last two decades, a large population of close-in planets has been detected around a wide variety of host stars. Such exoplanets are likely to undergo planetary migration through magnetic and tidal interactions. Aims. We aim to follow the orbital evolution of a planet along the structural and rotational evolution of its host star, simultaneously taking into account tidal and magnetic torques, in order to explain some properties of the distribution of observed close-in planets. Methods. We rely on a numerical model of a coplanar circular star-planet system called ESPEM, which takes into account stellar structural changes, wind braking, and star-planet interactions. We browse the parameter space of the star-planet system configurations and assess the relative influence of magnetic and tidal torques on its secular evolution. We then synthesize star-planet populations and compare their distribution in orbital and stellar rotation periods to Kepler satellite data. Results. Magnetic and tidal interactions act together on planetary migration and stellar rotation. Furthermore, both interactions can dominate secular evolution depending on the initial configuration of the system and the evolutionary phase considered. Indeed, tidal effects tend to dominate for high stellar and planetary masses as well as low semi-major axis; they also govern the evolution of planets orbiting fast rotators while slower rotators evolve essentially through magnetic interactions. Moreover, three populations of star-planet systems emerge from the combined action of both kinds of interactions. First, systems undergoing negligible migration define an area of influence of star-planet interactions. For sufficiently large planetary magnetic fields, the magnetic torque determines the extension of this region. Next, planets close to fast rotators migrate efficiently during the pre-main sequence, which engenders a depleted region at low rotation and orbital periods. Then, the migration of planets close to slower rotators, which happens during the main sequence, may lead to a break in gyrochronology for high stellar and planetary masses. This also creates a region at high rotation periods and low orbital periods not populated by star-planet systems. We also find that star-planet interactions significantly impact the global distribution in orbital periods by depleting more planets for higher planetary masses and planetary magnetic fields. However, the global distribution in stellar rotation periods is marginally affected, as around 0.5% of G-type stars and 0.1% of K-type stars may spin up because of planetary engulfment. More precisely, star-planet magnetic interactions significantly affect the distribution of super-Earths around stars with a rotation period higher than around 5 days, which improves the agreement between synthetic populations and observations at orbital periods of less than 1 day. Tidal effects for their part shape the distribution of giant planets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

Method: Using multilevel negative binomial regression, crime is forecasted into the subsequent year, in 50-m grid-cells. Incidence rate ratio (IRR), Prediction Accuracy Index (PAI), and Prediction Efficacy Index (PEI*) are interpreted for all combined crime generators and community characteristics. This study is partially a test of a crude version of the Risk Terrain Modeling technique. Results: Where crime has been in the past, the risk for future crime is higher. Where characteristics conducive to crime congregate, the risk for crime is higher. Community structural characteristics and ambient population are important for some crime types. Combining variables increases the accuracy for most crime types, looking at the IRR. Taking the geographical area into account, crime history in combination with both place- and neighborhood characteristics reaches similar accuracy as crime history alone for most crime types and most hotspot cutoffs. Conclusions: Crime history, place-, and neighborhood-level attributes are all important when trying to accurately forecast crime, long-term at the micro-place.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data sourced from the NCRB covering violent crimes, property crimes, economic crimes and total crimes under the Indian Penal Code across 27 states and 2 union territories in India. Crime rates per 100,000 people are calculated using projected population figures from the 2001 and 2011 censuses, adjusting for census periods and growth rates. Economic variables such as per capita real gross state domestic product (GSDP) and total police expenditure are obtained from state government sources, adjusted to constant prices. Pooled ordinary least squares analysis is conducted to explore the relationships between crime rates, conviction rate, economic factors and police expenditure over the three-time points: 2001, 2011 and 2021. Findings: The study reveals a complex relationship between police expenditure and crime rates across different categories in India. Increased police expenditure is positively associated with higher reporting rates for violent and economic crimes, suggesting that enhanced law enforcement resources may improve crime detection and reporting. However, contrary to some expectations, higher police spending does not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall crime rates. Economic prosperity, measured by per capita GSDP, is found to reduce violent crime rates but is associated with an increase in property and economic crimes, likely due to the greater opportunities for such crimes in wealthier regions. Research limitations/implications: The study’s reliance on state-level aggregate data and NCRB crime statistics, which are based on reported incidents, might not fully capture the true extent of criminal activity, particularly in regions with underreporting issues. In addition, the use of projected population data beyond 2001 and 2011 introduces some uncertainty into the analysis. Future research should explore district-level data to better understand regional variations in crime and incorporate social, cultural and innovative policing strategies to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Practical implications: Policymakers should recognize the nuanced impacts of police expenditure and economic prosperity on crime rates. While increased law enforcement resources may enhance crime reporting, they do not guarantee a reduction in overall crime rates. Economic growth, while beneficial in reducing violent crimes, may inadvertently increase property and economic crimes due to greater opportunities for criminal activity. These insights suggest the need for targeted interventions that consider both economic factors and law enforcement strategies in crime prevention efforts. Originality/value: This study contributes to the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of police expenditure in reducing crime by highlighting its limited impact on overall crime rates in India. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the diverse effects of economic prosperity on different crime types, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to design evidence-based crime prevention strategies that account for socioeconomic disparities and regional contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Progresses and Challenges of Crime Geography and Crime Analysis[SEP]Crime Geography and spatial analysis of crime has gained great momentum lately, coupled with the advancement of geographic information science (GIScience) and big data in human mobility.

The acronym of DEPPA captures these five elements. Pattern detection uncovers spatio-temporal patterns of crime distribution, such as crime hotspots. Crime explanation aims to discern major contributing factors based on multivariate regression modeling and machine learning.

Magnetic gradiometry revealed countless subterranean storage pits, hearths, and two previously unknown fortification systems that vastly increase the settlement's area and projected population to perhaps 2,000 individuals. Electrical resistance surveys helped define middens, other depositional areas, houses, and earth-borrowing pits. Ground-penetrating radar yielded details about ditch, house, and mounded midden interior forms. Aerial survey from a powered parachute acquired high-resolution digital color and thermal infrared imagery. The former distinguished houses, borrow pits, and ditches from middens and fill areas by changes in vegetation: the latter did the same through temperature variations that also highlighted historic excavations. High-resolution topographic survey allowed documentation of topographic expressions caused by ditches, houses, borrow pits, and mounds. The remote sensing program reduced excavation costs by targeting features. Excavations confirmed anomaly identifications and established a chronology that documents late-fifteenth- century origins to an ultimate contraction in the eighteenth century, with abandonment after a smallpox outbreak about A.D. 1785. Evidence suggests that large mounds formed integral components of the village's defenses. Excavations also reveal extensive earth moving for mound building, earthlodge coverings, and other reasons still unclear. This practice caused the truncation or obliteration of many earlier archaeological features and forces realization that long-occupied settlements were fluid through time with continual reworking of deposits, and complex depositional, use, and formation histories.

By integrating human bone, teeth, and environmental samples this research tests the hypothesis of the persistent importance of community-wide seasonal pastoral transhumance during the early formation of complex settlement systems of the South Caucasus. Methods: This research applies stable oxygen and radiogenic strontium isotope analyses on incremental samples of human tooth enamel, bulk tooth enamel, and bone to resolve mobility patterns. Sequential and bulk sampling techniques elucidate seasonal and residential mobility behaviors. Extensive environmental isotope samples of plant and water were collected through regional survey and establish local and regional isotopic baselines, which are compared to human isotope analysis results. Results: Qızqala individuals exhibit low isotopic variability compared to regional contemporaries. 87Sr/86Sr ratios from human remains indicate seasonal and residential isotopic variability within the baseline ranges of local landscapes. δ18O values display erratic patterns, but correspond to seasonal variability with fluctuations between highland and lowland altitudinal zone baseline values. Conclusions: Results suggest that isotopic analysis of multiple elements and sequential enamel samples offers finer resolution on the complexities of human mobility strategies and elucidate the daily lives of often overlooked mobile populations. Higher resolution of individual mobility reveals shared routine behaviors that underscore the importance of diverse social collaborations in forming complex polities in the South Caucasus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Pollution and human mobility in the southern Levant during the Iron Age using chemical and isotopic analysis of human tooth enamel[SEP]The extent of pollution and human mobility in the Iron Age in the southern Levant is estimated in this study through lead (Pb) and strontium (Sr) concentrations and isotopic compositions in human tooth enamel. The concentrations of Pb and other trace metals (Cu, Co, Cd, Zn) and Pb/Ca along with Ba/Ca ratios are used to determine background levels of metals and exposure to metal pollution. Strontium isotopic ratios are used to trace individuals’ residence as children and young adults, and Pb isotopic ratios are used for determining sources of in-vivo pollution. Seven teeth from the Natufian to the Pre-pottery Neolithic periods were used to establish metal-concentration baselines, and their Pb concentrations were compared with previous results. Forty-one additional samples (31 individuals) were selected from secure archaeological contexts, mostly urban sites, from the Iron Age (~1200 ‒ 586 BCE; 28 individuals) and from the Persian Period (~586–332 BCE; 3 individuals). Based on their Pb/Ca ratios, five individuals were found to be in-vivo polluted, and four additional individuals were possibly polluted, all dating to the Iron Age, suggesting that just under a third of the sampled Iron Age individuals were exposed to heavy metals to some extent. All individuals except one (from the coastal site of Dor) plot within the 87Sr/86Sr range of local, bioavailable Sr in soils (0.7058–0.7102). The unpolluted and possibly polluted individuals from coastal sites have a different 87Sr/86Sr range (0.7081–0.7112) than the inland unpolluted individuals (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7079–0.7084), suggesting that the former have more coastal/marine contribution in their diet. This Sr isotopic distribution pattern reflects a generally non-mobile population in both coastal and inland sites. Polluted Iron Age individuals, on the other hand, from both inland and coastal sites, have 87Sr/86Sr values which fall in a narrow range (0.7083–0.7086), possibly affected to some extent by coastal/marine sediments. Lead isotopic composition of four out of five individuals clearly deviate from local soil values, indicating an external contribution of Pb, some of which possibly originated from lead-rich Cu-ores in the Arabah. We thus propose a correlation between pollution and mobility in the Iron Age southern Levant. A possible explanation might be that polluted individuals had interactions with the coast or the marine environments, where they came into contact with metals, as a result of exposure to metalworking, use and/or trade. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"

         "['Current state and future perspectives on de facto population markers for normalization in wastewater-based epidemiology: A systematic literature review[SEP]Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and wastewater surveillance have become a valuable complementary data source to collect information on community-wide exposure through the measurement of human biomarkers in influent wastewater (IWW). In WBE, normalization of data with the de facto population that corresponds to a wastewater sample is crucial for a correct interpretation of spatio-temporal trends in exposure and consumption patterns. However, knowledge gaps remain in identifying and validating suitable de facto population biomarkers (PBs) for refinement of WBE back-estimations. WBE studies that apply de facto PBs (including hydrochemical parameters, utility consumption data sources, endo- and exogenous chemicals, biological biomarkers and signalling records) for relative trend analysis and absolute population size estimation were systematically reviewed from three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS) according to the PRISMA guidelines. We included in this review 81 publications that accounted for daily variations in population sizes by applying de facto population normalization. To date, a wide range of PBs have been proposed for de facto population normalization, complicating the comparability of normalized measurements across WBE studies. Additionally, the validation of potential PBs is complicated by the absence of an ideal external validator, magnifying the overall uncertainty for population normalization in WBE. Therefore, this review proposes a conceptual tier-based cross-validation approach for identifying and validating de facto PBs to guide their integration for i) relative trend analysis, and ii) absolute population size estimation. Furthermore, this review also provides a detailed evaluation of the uncertainty observed when comparing different de jure and de facto population estimation approaches. This study shows that their percentual differences can range up to ±200 %, with some exceptions showing even larger variations. This review underscores the need for collaboration among WBE researchers to further streamline the application of de facto population normalization and to evaluate the robustness of different PBs in different socio-demographic communities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Evaluating Wastewater Quality Parameters as an Alternative or Complement to Molecular Indicators for Normalization during SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater-Based Epidemiology[SEP]Measuring fecal nucleic acid indicators for data normalization can increase costs during wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The efficacy of routinely assayed water quality parameters was assessed as an alternative or complement to fecal nucleic acid viral indicator data for their utility in adjusting measured SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations to improve the relationship between wastewater molecular data and clinical COVID-19 case data. This research covers two study designs: grab samples collected from sewers serving The Ohio State University campus and composite influent samples collected at five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the state of Ohio. Weekly mandatory clinical testing was used to monitor infections in the student population, and statewide cases were reported through voluntary clinical testing. Statewide WWTP results showed significant strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the wastewater and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and correlation increased when normalized by flow and additionally increased when normalized by pH, total suspended solids, and temperature, but correlation decreased when normalized by a nucleic acid fecal viral indicator (PMMoV). On campus, correlations were generally not significant unless normalized by PMMoV and/or UV absorbance parameters. Because water quality parameters are routinely assayed at wastewater treatment plants and some may be collected by autosamplers, incorporating wastewater quality data may improve WBE models and could minimize molecular and cellular testing for fecal indicators to decrease costs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.', 'Impact of physicochemical parameters on nicotine metabolites and Bisphenol A in municipal wastewater: A pilot study in a German metropolitan area[SEP]Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach for assessing population-level exposures to toxicants and lifestyle factors. Our pilot investigated the spatial variability of biomarkers indicating exposure to nicotine and endocrine disrupting chemicals in municipal wastewater, taking into account important covariates, i.e. physicochemical wastewater parameters and sewershed characteristics. We also tested normalization by an endogenous population marker. Twenty-four-hour composite samples (n = 24) were collected in a volume-proportional manner using automated samplers from four wastewater treatment plants in Essen, Germany, over three weeks in late 2023. Substances of public health concern, previously already quantified in wastewater and expected to be present in high concentrations, were analyzed using SPE-LC-HRMS. Concentrations were normalized to the reported population (de jure) and the daily mass load of the catecholamine metabolite vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) as a proxy for the de facto population. Spatial variations were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Nicotine metabolites (cotinine, hydroxycotinine) and the industrial chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) were quantifiable in all wastewater samples. The population-normalized daily mass load of nicotine metabolites (median range: 0.6–1.6 g/d/1000 inh) and BPA (2.5–4.0 g/d/1000 inh) varied between the WWTPs, but the observed variation disappeared when adjusting for wastewater temperature (nicotine) and wastewater pH (BPA). Normalization to the VMA daily mass load resulted in different spatial patterns and increased the variance considerably. Our findings highlight the importance of adjusting for physicochemical characteristics when analyzing community-wide differences in exposure to toxicants and lifestyle factors via wastewater, to ensure accurate interpretations of the underlying drivers of these differences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.']"
